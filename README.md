DEMO LINK: (insert link)

Overview: Part visual novel with slight elements of horror, and is supposed to be part platformer. You play as a dust bunny that explores an office setting.

Original music by Dary Demchuk, and original sprites drawn by Isabel Gallard

The story is a critique on capitalist work culture and how we're expected to 'work to the bone' in a 9-5 office job for the rest of our lives.

Difficulties: Writing a good story along with managing our time.

Things learned: learned how to code sequential events, code visual novels and platformers in godot 

What we enjoyed: The creative process


Notes:

Make sure to attach the visualnovel.gd script to a 2Dnode, or else it won't run. I tried saving it to a node but for some reason Godot just saves the script itself.
